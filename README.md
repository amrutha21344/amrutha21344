# Task 2

 # Project 1 - Ticket Terminal Designer: Developing an Automated Parking Ticket Vending Machine

Developing an automated parking ticket vending machine in C involves managing hardware interactions, user inputs, payment processing, and ticket dispensing. Below is a simplified example that covers basic functionalities using console inputs to simulate user interactions.

# Explanation

**Main Function:** Controls the flow of the program, interacting with users until the ticket is purchased.

**Global Variables:** total_collected keeps track of the amount inserted by the user, ticket_available indicates whether a ticket is available for purchase.

# Functions

**display_instructions():** Prints initial instructions to the user.

**accept_coin(float coin):** Accepts coins and updates total_collected.

**process_payment():** Checks if enough money has been collected to print a ticket.

**print_ticket():** Simulates printing a ticket after successful payment.

**cancel_transaction():** Cancels the transaction and resets total_collected.

# Task 3

# SPIKE simulation and verification with -O1 and -OFast along with running the RISK-V Objdump

SPIKE Simulation

SPIKE is a RISC-V ISA Simulator, which can simulate RISC-V processors. It's often used for testing RISC-V software and running RISC-V assembly code. To simulate and verify your RISC-V design using SPIKE:

1. Compile your RISC-V program: Assume you have a RISC-V program written in assembly or C (which can be compiled to RISC-V assembly). Compile it with different optimization levels using a RISC-V cross-compiler. For example, if you have a program program.c, you might compile it with:
   
       riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -march=rv64imafdc program.c -o program_O1.elf
       riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -march=rv64imafdc program.c -o program_Ofast.elf

  Replace program.c with your actual program file name.

3. Run the simulation with SPIKE: SPIKE typically takes the ELF executable file generated by the RISC-V compiler and simulates its execution. To run your program with SPIKE:

       spike pk program_O1.elf
       spike pk program_Ofast.elf

 Here, pk is the proxy kernel that SPIKE uses to run programs. Replace program_O1.elf and program_Ofast.elf with your actual executable names.

5. Observe and verify results: SPIKE will simulate the execution of your program with the specified optimization level (-O1 or -Ofast). You can observe the programâ€™s output, performance, and behavior to verify correctness and performance differences between different optimization levels.

7. ![Screenshot 2024-06-28 123716](https://github.com/amrutha21344/amrutha21344/assets/150883697/8dd8bced-b9ad-468b-9865-85459ee09d95)


**Objdump Analysis**

Objdump is a utility that can display information about ELF files, including the assembly instructions. To analyze the assembly output:

1. Generate assembly code: Use objdump to generate assembly listings from your compiled ELF files:

       riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d program_O1.elf > program_O1.asm
       riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d program_Ofast.elf > program_Ofast.asm

      This will create program_O1.asm and program_Ofast.asm files containing the disassembled code for -O1 and -Ofast optimizations, respectively.

2. Compare assembly listings: Open these .asm files and compare the generated assembly code for the different optimization levels. Look for differences in instruction sequences, loop unrolling, function inlining, or other optimizations performed by the compiler.

3. Analyze performance implications: Understand how different optimization levels affect the size and efficiency of the generated code. -Ofast typically enables more aggressive optimizations compared to -O1, which can result in faster but potentially larger code.
