# VSDS QUARDRON MINI INTERNSHIP

Overview of VSDSquadron Mini Kit

TASK 1

TASK 2



# Description: 

The VSDQuadron Mini Internship offers a hands-on experience focused on developing and working with a state-of-the-art development board. This internship is designed for aspiring engineers and developers who are keen to delve into the world of embedded systems and hardware design. Participants will gain practical knowledge and experience in programming, interfacing, and utilizing various features of the VSDQuadron development board.

# Board Features:

**32-bit RISC-V Core:**

   The heart of the VSDQuadron development board is a powerful 32-bit RISC-V processor. This open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) is known for its flexibility and scalability, making it an excellent choice for educational and development purposes.
   
**Multiple Clock Options:**

   The board provides various clock configurations, allowing participants to explore different operational frequencies and power modes. This feature is crucial for optimizing performance and energy consumption in embedded applications.
15 GPIO Pins: The board is equipped with 15 General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins. These versatile pins can be programmed for various functions, including digital input, digital output, and more. They are essential for interfacing with external sensors, actuators, and other peripherals.

# Task 2

 # Project 1 - Ticket Terminal Designer: Developing an Automated Parking Ticket Vending Machine

Developing an automated parking ticket vending machine in C involves managing hardware interactions, user inputs, payment processing, and ticket dispensing. Below is a simplified example that covers basic functionalities using console inputs to simulate user interactions.

# Explanation

**Main Function:** Controls the flow of the program, interacting with users until the ticket is purchased.

**Global Variables:** total_collected keeps track of the amount inserted by the user, ticket_available indicates whether a ticket is available for purchase.

# Functions

**display_instructions():** Prints initial instructions to the user.

**accept_coin(float coin):** Accepts coins and updates total_collected.

**process_payment():** Checks if enough money has been collected to print a ticket.

**print_ticket():** Simulates printing a ticket after successful payment.

**cancel_transaction():** Cancels the transaction and resets total_collected.
