Overview of VSDSquadron Mini Kit

TASK 1

TASK 2



# Description: 

The VSDQuadron Mini Internship offers a hands-on experience focused on developing and working with a state-of-the-art development board. This internship is designed for aspiring engineers and developers who are keen to delve into the world of embedded systems and hardware design. Participants will gain practical knowledge and experience in programming, interfacing, and utilizing various features of the VSDQuadron development board.

# Board Features:

**32-bit RISC-V Core:**

   The heart of the VSDQuadron development board is a powerful 32-bit RISC-V processor. This open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) is known for its flexibility and scalability, making it an excellent choice for educational and development purposes.
   
**Multiple Clock Options:**

   The board provides various clock configurations, allowing participants to explore different operational frequencies and power modes. This feature is crucial for optimizing performance and energy consumption in embedded applications.
15 GPIO Pins: The board is equipped with 15 General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins. These versatile pins can be programmed for various functions, including digital input, digital output, and more. They are essential for interfacing with external sensors, actuators, and other peripherals.
